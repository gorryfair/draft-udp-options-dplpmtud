    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a robust method for calculating checksums for
      use with UDP Options.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>UDP Options <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref> adds
      support for transport options in UDP <xref target="RFC0768"></xref>. When
      UDP is carried in IP two lengths describing the UDP datagram, the IP
      transport carries a payload length and the UDP header carries the length
      of the UDP datagram.  Most of the time today IP payload length is equal
      to the UDP length, UDP Options creates a surplus area by adding increasing
      the IP payload length while not varying the UDP length. Transport Options
      are then added in this surplus area in the form of a TLV encoded
      list.</t>

      <t>UDP datagrams with surplus data are a new in the network, many
      network devices assume that IP payload length is equal to UDP length and
      have used this value when calculating UDP checksums. This leads to many
      network devices incorrectly calculating the UDP checksum when forwarding
      packets leading to UDP datagrams with Options being dropped by these
      devices.</t>

      <t>This document describes common pathologies of network devices which
      incorrectly calculate the UDP checksum and proposes a new UDP Option to
      compensate for incorrect UDP checksum calculation.
      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="middlebox-pathologies" title="Middlebox Pathologies">
	<t> Middleboxes and network interfaces can compute UDP Checksum
	incorrectly in presence of UDP Options based on the assumption that IP
	Payload Length and UDP Length coincide (an assumption that was
	reasonable before UDP Options). </t>

	<t> They middleboxes use the IP Payload Length (obtained as IP Total
	Length -  IP Header Length) to fill UDP pseudo-header Length and also
	computes the checksum over the all IP Payload bytes.  </t>

	<t> This can lead to UDP Options packets with correct checksum to be
	discarded by end-hosts or by middleboxes along the path.  </t>

	<t><xref target="fig-udpsumcalc"></xref>shows UDP Checksum computation
	based on UDP Length and based on IP Payload Length and the fields which
	differ between the two calculation methods.  </t>

	<t> The purpose of CCO is to increase UDP Options compatibility with
	middleboxes and other existing network equipment, while at the same
	time providing error detection on UDP Options area in the same way UDP
	Checksum provides it on UDP Header and UDP Payload.  </t>

	<t>CCO provides a way for UDP Option packets to be compatible with both
	checksum computations making UDP Checksum computed on the whole IP
	Payload coincide with the one correctly computed on the sole UDP
	Length. </t>

	<t> The Checksum Compensation Option (CCO) is the 2 byte one's
	complement of the one's complement sum of all 2 byte words in the UDP
	Options. UDP Options area is divided into 2 byte words based on the
	their alignment with the first byte of UDP packet (and not the first
	byte of UDP Options). This means that the first and the last byte of
	UDP Options may be not preceded or followed by another byte: in these
	cases the unpaired byte must padded respectively on the left and on the
	right with zero to form a 2 byte word.  </t>
