    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a robust method for calculating checksums for
      use with UDP Options.  The new method proposes an alternative checksum
      calculation for coverage of the option space. This is based on the IP
      checksum calculation, but uses an updated pseudoheader. The new method
      only checks the option portion of a UDP packet, but creates a checksum
      that compensates for the range of IPv4 and UDP chekcsum validation
      methods that have been deployed, in this way the new method enhances the
      proability of NAPT traversal for packets that carry UDP-Options.  </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>UDP Options <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref> adds
      support for transport options in UDP <xref target="RFC0768"></xref>. When
      UDP is carried in IP two length fields describe the UDP datagram, the IP
      transport carries a payload length and the UDP header carries the length
      of the UDP datagram. In most datagrams currently forwarded by network
      devices the IP payload length is equal to the UDP length, UDP Options
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref> creates a surplus area
      by increasing the IP payload length while not varying the UDP length.
      Transport Options are then added in this surplus area in the form of a
      TLV encoded list.</t>

      <t> The current specification for UDP permits sending datagrams with
      surplus data, but are not commonly observed, and many network devices
      assume that IP payload length is equal to UDP length and have used this
      value when calculating UDP checksums. This leads to the case where some
      middlebox devices (e.g. Firewalls, NAPT) and some endpoint
      implementations check or modify the the UDP checksum in a way that leads
      to discard of UDP datagrams that carry UDP options.</t>

      <t>This document describes common pathologies of network devices that 
      incorrectly calculate the UDP checksum and proposes a new UDP Option to
      compensate for incorrect UDP checksum calculation.

    <section anchor="middlebox-pathologies" title="Middlebox Pathologies">
	<t> Middleboxes and network interfaces can compute the UDP Checksum
	incorrectly in the presence of UDP Options based on the assumption that
	IP Payload Length and UDP Length coincide (an assumption that was
	equivalent before UDP Options). </t>

	<t> These middleboxes use the IP Payload Length (obtained as IP Total
	Length -  IP Header Length) to fill UDP pseudo-header Length field and
	also compute the checksum over the all IP Payload bytes.  </t>

	<t> This can lead to UDP Options packets that carry a correctly
	calculated checksum to be discarded by end-hosts or by middleboxes

    <section anchor="UDPOPT-CCO" title="Checksum Compensation Option">

	<t>This section introduces the Checksum Compensation Option (CCO),
	which suggests a new way to calculate the checksum for the option
	field.</t>

	<t> The design of the CCO seeks to increase UDP Options compatibility
	with middleboxes and other existing network equipment, while at the
	same time providing error detection on UDP Options area in the same way
	that the UDP Checksum provides an integrity check for the UDP Header
	and UDP Payload.  </t>

	<t>CCO provides a checksum for UDP Option packets that is compatible
	with both variants of the checksum computation making the final value
	of the UDP Checksum computed on the whole IP Payload coincide with the
	the value that would be correctly computed soley on the UDP Length.
	</t>

	<t> The Checksum Compensation Option (CCO) is the 2 byte one's
	complement of the one's complement sum of all 2 byte words in the UDP
	Options. The UDP Options area is divided into 2 byte words based on the
	their alignment with the first byte of UDP packet (and not the first
	byte of UDP Options). This means that the first and the last byte of
	UDP Options can not preceded or be followed by another byte: in these
	cases the unpaired byte must padded respectively on the left and on the
	right with zero to form a 2 byte word.  </t>
