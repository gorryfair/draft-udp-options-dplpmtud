	This document describes how a UDP Options sender may implement Datagram
	Packetization Layer Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (DPLPMTUD)
	as a robust method for Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery.

    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
	<t> The User Datagram Protocol <xref target="RFC0768"></xref> offers a
	minimal transport service on top of IP and is frequently used as a
	substrate for other protocols. Applications using UDP frequently have
	to implement basic transport services such as Path Maximum Transmission
	Unit Discover (PMTUD) themselves. Section 3.5 of UDP Guidelines (<xref
	target="RFC8085"></xref>) recommends that applications implement some
	form of Path MTU Discovery to avoid the generation of IP fragments:
	</t>

	<t> "Consequently, an application SHOULD either use the path MTU
	information provided by the IP layer or implement Path MTU Discovery
	(PMTUD)" </t>

	<t> The UDP API <xref target="RFC8304"></xref> offers calls for
	applications to receive ICMP PTB messages and to control the size of
	messages sent, but does not offering any automatic mechanisms to
	discover the PMTU. Applications are left to implement robust PMTUD
	mechanisms of their own.</t>

	<t> PLPMTUD <xref target="RFC4821"></xref> describes some of the issues
	with classical PMTUD and describes a method for a Packetization Layer
	to search for the largest MTU supported on a path in the absence of
	ICMP PTB messages. However, the algorithm described in PLPMTUD only
	covers TCP and SCTP.  </t>

	<t> Datagram PLPMTUD <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud"></xref>
	describes PMTUD probing and search algorithms for Datagram transports
	in the absence of ICMP PTB messages allowing the Packetization Layer
	is able to offer a probing mechanism which works in the presence of
	lost probes. However UDP is unable to offer the required probing
	mechanisms to implement DPLPMTUD without some additional transport
	services.</t>

	<t> This document describes the additional functionality required to
	perform DPLPMTUD with UDP Options as a service to application layer
	protocols.</t>

      <section anchor="UDPOPT-PLPMTUD" title="DPLPMTUD with UDP Options">
        <t>UDP Options<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref> can
        supply the additional functionality required to implement DPLPMTUD
        within the UDP transport service. Implementing DPLPMTUD using UDP
        Options avoids the need for each application to implement the DPLPMTUD
        method.</t>

        <t>Section 5.6 of<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref>
        defines the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option, which allows the local
        sender to indicate the EMTU_R to the peer. The value received in this
        option can be used to initialise MAX_PMTU.</t>

        <t>UDP Options enables padding to be added to UDP datagrams that are
        used as Probe Packets. Feedback confirming reception of each Probe
        Packet is provided by two new UDP Options:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The Probe Request Option (<xref
            target="UDPOPT-ECHOREQ"></xref>) is set by a sending PL to solicit
            a response from a remote endpoint. A four-byte token identifies
            each request.</t>

            <t>The Probe Response Option (<xref
            target="UDPOPT-ECHORES"></xref> is generated by the UDP Options
            receiver in response to reception of a previously received Probe
            Request Option. Each Probe Response Option echoes a previously
            received four-byte token.</t>
          </list>The token value allows implementations to be distinguish
        between acknowledgements for initial probe packets and
        acknowledgements confirming receipt of subsequent probe packets (e.g.,
        travelling along alternate paths with a larger RTT). Each probe packet
        needs to be uniquely identifiable by the UDP Options sender within the
        Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL). The UDP Options sender therefore needs
        to not recycle token values until they have expired or have been
        acknowledged. A 4 byte value for the token field provides sufficient
        space for multiple unique probes to be made within the MSL.</t>

        <t>The initial value of the four byte token field SHOULD be assigned
        to a randomised value, as described in section 5.1 of <xref
        target="RFC8085"></xref>) to enhance protection from off-path
        attacks.</t>

        <t>Implementations ought to only send a probe packet with a Request
        Probe Option when required by their local state machine, i.e., when
        probing to grow the PLPMTU or to confirm the current PLPMTU. The
        procedure to handle the loss of a response packet is the
        responsibility of the sender of the request. Implementations are
        allowed to track multiple requests and respond to them with a single
        packet.</t>

        <t>A PL needs to determine that the path can still support the size of
        datagram that the application is currently sending in the DPLPMTUD
        search_done state (i.e., to detect black-holing of data). One way to
        achieve this is to send probe packets of size PLPMTU or to utilise a
        higher-layer method that provides explicit feedback indicating any
        packet loss. Another possibility is to utilise data packets that carry
        a Timestamp Option. Reception of a valid timestamp that was echoed by
        the remote endpoint can be used to infer connectivity. This can
        provide useful feedback even over paths with asymmetric capacity
        and/or that carry UDP Option flows that have very asymmetric datagram
        rates, because an echo of the most recent timestamp still indicates
        reception of at least one packet of the transmitted size. This is
        sufficient to confirm there is no black hole.</t>

        <t>In contrast, when sending a probe to increase the PLPMTU, a
        timestamp might be unable to unambiguously identify that a specific
        probe packet has been received. Timestamp mechanisms cannot be used to
        confirm the reception of individual probe messages and cannot be used
        to stimulate a response from the remote peer.</t>

	  <t>RFC Editor remove this section before publication</t>
          <t>The Probe Request Option allows a sending endpoint to solicit a
          response from a destination endpoint.</t>

          <t>The Probe Request Option carries a four byte token set by the
          sender. This token can be set to a value that is likely to be known
          only to the sender (and is sent along the end-to-end path). The
          initial value of the token SHOULD be assigned to a randomised value,
          as described in section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>) to
          enhance protection from off-path attacks.</t>

          <t>The sender needs to then check the value returned in the UDP
          Probe Response Option. The value of the Token field, uniquely
          identifies a probe within the maximum segment lifetime.</t>

          <t>The Probe Response Option is generated in response to reception
          of a previously received Probe Request Option. This response is
          generated by the UDP Option processing.</t>

          <t>The Probe Response Option carries a four byte token field. The
          Token field associates the response with the Token value carried in
          the most recently-received Echo Request. The rate of generation of
          UDP packets carrying a Probe Response Option is expected to be less
          than once per RTT and SHOULD be rate-limited (see <xref
