    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how a UDP Options sender implements
      Datagram Packetization Layer Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery
      (DPLPMTUD) as a robust method for Path Maximum Transmission Unit
      Discovery.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The User Datagram Protocol <xref target="RFC0768"></xref> offers a
      minimal transport service on top of IP and is frequently used as a
      substrate for other protocols. Applications using UDP frequently have to
      implement basic transport services such as Path Maximum Transmission
      Unit Discovery (PMTUD) themselves. Section 3.5 of UDP Guidelines <xref
      target="RFC8085"></xref> recommends that applications implement some
      form of Path MTU Discovery to avoid the generation of IP fragments:</t>

      <t>"Consequently, an application SHOULD either use the path MTU
      information provided by the IP layer or implement Path MTU Discovery
      (PMTUD)".</t>

      <t>The UDP API <xref target="RFC8304"></xref> offers calls for
      applications to receive ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages and to
      control the size of messages that are sent, but does not offer any
      automatic mechanisms for an application to discover the maximum packet
      size supported by a path. Applications and upper layer protocols are
      left to implement robust PMTUD mechanisms of their own.</t>

      <t>Packetization Layer PMTUD (PLPMTUD) <xref target="RFC4821"></xref>
      describes a method for a Packetization Layer (such as UDP with options)
      to search for the largest MTU supported on a path in the absence of ICMP
      PTB messages. Datagram PLPMTUD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud"></xref> describes PMTUD probing
      and search algorithms for datagram transports that does not solely rely
      on ICMP PTB messages. This allows the Packetization Layer to offer a
      probing mechanism which works in the presence of lost probes. However,
      UDP is unable itself to offer the required probing mechanisms to
      implement DPLPMTUD without some additional transport services. This
      document specifies the additional functionality required to perform
      DPLPMTUD with UDP Options as a service to upper-layer protocols.</t>

      <t>UDP Options <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref> supplies
      additional functionality that can be used to implement DPLPMTUD within
      the UDP transport service. Implementing DPLPMTUD using UDP Options
      avoids the need for each upper layer protocol or application to
      implement the DPLPMTUD method.</t>

      <t>Section 5.6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref>
      defines the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option, which allows the local
      sender to indicate the EMTU_R to the peer. The value received in this
      option can be used to initialise MAX_PMTU used by DPLPMTUD.</t>

      when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>The structure of the present document follows the structure used to
      describe DPLPMTUD for other transports <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud"></xref>. </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="UDPOPT-PLPMTUD" title="DPLPMTUD for UDP Options">

      <t>The DPLPMTUD method <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud">
      </xref> relies upon the sender Packetization Layer to be able to
      generate probe packets with a specific size. UDP Options enables padding
      to be added to a UDP datagram that is used as these Probe Packets.
      Feedback confirming reception of each Probe Packet is provided by two
      UDP Options described in section 6 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Echo Request Option (RES)
          is set by a sending PL to solicit a response from a remote endpoint.
          A four-byte token identifies each request.</t>

          <t>The Echo Response Option (REQ)
          is generated by the UDP Options receiver in response to reception of
          a previously received Echo Request Option. Each Echo Response
          Option echoes a previously received four-byte token.</t>
        </list>The token value allows implementations to distinguish
      between acknowledgements for initial probe packets and acknowledgements
      confirming receipt of subsequent probe packets (e.g., travelling along
      alternate paths with a larger RTT). Each probe packet needs to be
      uniquely identifiable by the UDP Options sender within the Maximum
      Segment Lifetime (MSL). The UDP Options sender therefore needs to not
      recycle token values until they have expired or have been acknowledged.
      A four byte value for the token field provides sufficient space for
      multiple unique probes to be made within the MSL.</t>

      <t>The initial value of the four byte token field SHOULD be assigned to
      a randomised value to enhance protection from off-path
      attacks, as described in section 5.1 of <xref
      target="RFC8085"></xref>). </t>

      <t>Implementations ought to only send a probe packet with a Request Probe
      Option when required by their local DPLPMTUD state machine, i.e., when
      probing to grow the PLPMTU or to confirm the current PLPMTU. The
      procedure to handle the loss of a response packet is the responsibility
      of the sender of the request. Implementations MAY track multiple requests
      and respond to them with a single packet.</t>

      <t>A PL needs to determine that the current path can still support the
      size of datagram that the application is currently sending in the
      DPLPMTUD search_done state (i.e., to detect black-holing of data). One
      way to achieve this is to send probe packets of size PLPMTU or to
      utilise a higher-layer method that provides explicit feedback indicating
      any packet loss.</t>

      <t> The recommended approach to generate probe packets is to send a probe
      using control information, there are two alternative approaches to
      sending probes packets, sending padding data with the UDP Options
      Timestamps option and sending application data with a Timestamps
      Option.</t>

      <section title="Sending Packet Probes using Control Information">
        <t>The recommended approach to implementing DPLPMTUD sends a Probe
        Packet that contains only control information together with any
        padding that is needed to be inflated to the size required for the
        probe packet. These probe packets do not carry an application-supplied
        data block and therefore they do not typically require retransmission,
        although they do still consume network capacity and incur endpoint
        processing (see Section 4.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud"></xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending Packet Probes using Timestamps">
	<t>Reception of a valid Timestamps Option that was echoed by the remote
	endpoint can also be used to infer connectivity. This can provide
	useful feedback even over paths with asymmetric capacity and/or that
	carry UDP Option flows that have very asymmetric datagram rates,
	because an echo of the most recent timestamp still indicates reception
	of at least one packet of the transmitted size. This is sufficient to
	confirm there is no black hole (see Section 2.1 of <xref
	target="RFC2923"></xref>).</t>

	<t>If the application/transport needs protection from the loss of data
	in the Probe payload, the application/ transport could perform
	transport-layer retransmission/repair of the data block (e.g., by
	retransmission after loss is detected or by duplicating the data block
	in a datagram without the padding) <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>.</t>

	<t>When sending a probe to increase the PLPMTU, a Timestamp might be
	unable to unambiguously identify that a specific probe packet has been
	received <xref target="KP87"></xref> . Timestamp mechanisms cannot be
	used to confirm the reception of individual probe messages and cannot
	be used to stimulate a response from the remote peer.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending Packet Probes using Application Data">
        <t>Another possibility is to utilise data packets for Probe Packets
        (Section 4.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud"></xref>
        discusses the merits and demerits of this approach). A probe packet
        then contains a data block supplied by an application that is combined
        with padding to inflate the length of the datagram to the size
        required for the probe and additionally contains a Timestamps
        Option (Section 5.9 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options"></xref>).</t>
